    description: 'This simple pasta dish is full of flavour, thanks to pork sausages, spicy chilli and a rich tomato sauce.',
    method:'1. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for around 7 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until starting to brown. Add the sausage meat and break up into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Cook for 3–4 minutes or until golden. Stir in the garlic then the tomato purée and cook for a further 2–3 minutes.\n2. Pour in the tomatoes. Use 400ml/14fl oz water to swill out the tins and add to the pan along with the oregano, chilli flakes and sugar. Simmer the sauce over a medium–low heat for 10 minutes so it can thicken slightly. Stir the kale into the sauce and cook for a further 5–10 minutes, until the leaves have softened. Add a splash of water to the pan if the sauce is looking too thick. Taste and season with salt, if needed.\n3. Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta and cook according to packet instructions. Drain the pasta, reserving a mugful of the pasta water. Add the pasta to the sauce in the frying pan and stir together, loosening with a splash of pasta water if needed to help coat the pasta.\n4. Remove from the heat, divide between bowls, top with the grated cheese and serve.' ,
